    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Making a big career change is never easy, especially if you&rsquo;ve got kids to support, a mortgage to pay, and a car to worry about. People will tell you you&rsquo;ve got it great where you are and that the grass is always greener on the other side. What they don&rsquo;t know is what&rsquo;s best for you. Switching careers doesn&rsquo;t have to be the daunting process everyone makes it out to be if you are organized, practical, and thorough with your research.</p>

<h4>Method 1 of 5: What Would You Rather Be Doing?</h4>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://www.wikihow.com/images/2/25/Switch-Careers-Step-1.jpg">http://www.wikihow.com/images/2/25/Switch-Careers-Step-1.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p><strong>1. Tackle the golden question</strong></p>

<p>If you had all the money in the world, what would you be doing with yourself? Don&rsquo;t hold back. This is brainstorming time. Make a list of all the things you&rsquo;d rather be doing with your time. Your first few answers will probably be something like: Take a tropical vacation, spend more time with the kids, etc. But push your thinking beyond that. Ask yourself if you are content with stringent working hours, accounting to higher authorities, etc. If this is what you don&rsquo;t like, then strive for a self-actualizing job that gives you exactly what you desire or hope to achieve.</p>

<p><strong>2. Consider careers that interest you.</strong></p>

<p>You might have studied accounting at college for the sake of job security and financial certainty. But all the time, perhaps you really wanted to be a park ranger or a freelance troubleshooter. Think back to what once motivated you when you were younger––you will often find the kernel of the things that still motivate and thrill you there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a list of the things you loved to do once and the career ideas you had.</li>
<li>Add down the ideas for preferred careers that you actually have now. Don&rsquo;t hold back for such reasons as &ldquo;lack training&rdquo; or &ldquo;no resources to risk it&rdquo;. At this stage, write down the career paths you&rsquo;d really rather be following.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Method 2 of 5: Working Out What Else You Can Do</h4>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://www.wikihow.com/images/3/36/Switch-Careers-Step-2.jpg">http://www.wikihow.com/images/3/36/Switch-Careers-Step-2.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p><strong>1. Evaluate your skills and talents.</strong>
Ask yourself: What am I good at? What do I most enjoy doing? Write down every skill you&rsquo;re capable of. Don&rsquo;t be shy. Does your current job give you satisfaction and utilize all your potential?</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://www.wikihow.com/images/a/ac/Switch-Careers-Step-3.jpg">http://www.wikihow.com/images/a/ac/Switch-Careers-Step-3.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p><strong>2. Identify transferable skills.</strong>
After having listed all known skills and talents, identify what skills will best transfer over into the new line of work you&rsquo;re hoping to change to. The longer the list, the easier the transition.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have only a few or no transferable skills, do not be discouraged. New skills can be easily learned, while old skills can act as the foundation blocks.</li>
<li>Other life experiences can also make this transition easy––remain conscious of the basic life skills that have already been acquired and avoid discounting them. Give yourself a boost and some credit.</li>
<li>Pursue your passion to find happiness. Is there a passion outside of your work that has brought you a range of skills that you might be able to use to bolster your transition case?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Think of jobs that allow you to do what you really want to do, at least in some form.</strong>
 In what ways will you be able to apply your skills and talents every day? Be creative and open-minded. Focus on what your inner feelings guide you to do.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://www.wikihow.com/images/e/e2/Switch-Careers-Step-7.jpg">http://www.wikihow.com/images/e/e2/Switch-Careers-Step-7.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p><strong>4. Make a list of everything you want in your new job.</strong> make one of everything you don&rsquo;t want, such as revisiting tedious aspects of your current job. Having this dual list of preferences to guide you will make it easier to check off the jobs that fit and delete the ones that don&rsquo;t; the list helps you to be more discerning and less ready to jump into the same situation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Be prepared to work gradually towards your needs and wants; steady accomplishments will make the career transition less risky and more likely to work out for you.</p></li>
<li><p>The list helps you to listen to your gut reactions and not ignore warnings that something isn&rsquo;t a good match for you. You are changing careers precisely because you want to remove yourself from the warnings, so heed that feeling if it arises.</p></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While a leader can be a boss, not every boss is a leader. Although leaders and</p>

<p>While a boss is mostly concerned with outcomes, a leader feels responsible for the process of that outcome and the people who see it out. Check out some major points that distinguish a leader from a boss:</p>

<h4>1. Leaders lead rather than rule.</h4>

<p>Throughout history, the best chiefs headed their troops in fights or campaigns or whatever. The troops were not afraid because their leader was right there with them. Leaders are there to lead the team forward and to move together.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t31.0-8/s960x960/10750009_414949625326965_7306927192227304603_o.jpg">https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t31.0-8/s960x960/10750009_414949625326965_7306927192227304603_o.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<h4>2. Leaders listen and speak rather than command.</h4>

<p>Bosses tend to give orders; they need their employees to listen and to obey. However, leaders always listen to the opinions of their colleagues and regard them as important.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://scontent-a-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/1901348_414949695326958_1617544880402520783_n.jpg?oh=f1cd8754b1f4cb16cf53b4270c3087d8&amp;oe=54EDAB49">https://scontent-a-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/1901348_414949695326958_1617544880402520783_n.jpg?oh=f1cd8754b1f4cb16cf53b4270c3087d8&amp;oe=54EDAB49</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>Leaders are always ready for advising, discussion and any feedback an employee has to offer. This reciprocity makes any individual employee feel stronger and gives him or her confidence to follow the leader.</p>

<h4>3. Leaders motivate rather than terrify.</h4>

<p>While working on projects, people have their ups and downs. Through this roller coaster, bosses are more likely to intimidate into action while leaders will motivate to action.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10734090_414949795326948_3416275930774179251_n.jpg?oh=810fc4bbc2c48acc50901f0ace834780&amp;oe=54D510A4&amp;__gda__=1425216796_844fce8da41177cca8e81b7e8420446f">https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10734090_414949795326948_3416275930774179251_n.jpg?oh=810fc4bbc2c48acc50901f0ace834780&amp;oe=54D510A4&amp;__gda__=1425216796_844fce8da41177cca8e81b7e8420446f</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>One of the best things about leaders is that they offer empathy and prepare a group for the tasks at hand. This is very important, seeing as whenever colleagues are not prepared for certain duties, leaders are there to support, teach and back them up. Leaders know that each employee is on the team for a reason and they have faith in every concerted effort.</p>

<h4>4. Leaders teach and learn rather than expect and ignore.</h4>

<p>A true leader is the person who has self-esteem, but who is not arrogant nor embarrassed to learn from those with lower titles. They know that it is never late to learn more.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10390082_414949875326940_5418551154960633658_n.jpg?oh=29e60279326157a42885c54f67bd5089&amp;oe=54F60741&amp;__gda__=1423894173_22dbfb4334e5d1b501a5a56f149bd558">https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10390082_414949875326940_5418551154960633658_n.jpg?oh=29e60279326157a42885c54f67bd5089&amp;oe=54F60741&amp;__gda__=1423894173_22dbfb4334e5d1b501a5a56f149bd558</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>This explains the tendency of leaders to always pay attention to their colleagues, knowing there is always more to learn from them. Moreover, leaders are not only takers, but givers, as well. A good leader is not greedy for sharing knowledge and experience with someone else; instead, the leader teaches and nurtures new professionals.</p>

<h4>5. Leaders take part rather than stay aside.</h4>

<p>While bosses choose to stay aside in the job, leaders take initiative. They watch over the progress of work, make adjustments where necessary and aid team members. They choose to be a part of the team rather than bossing the team around.</p>

<h4>6. Leaders reprimand rather than scold or shout.</h4>

<p>When necessary, a leader offers constructive criticism. However, a leader never scolds or shouts at any individual, especially in public. They do understand that they are dealing with people and no one has right to humiliate others. Rather, the leader talks to the person individually and without any spike in temper.</p>

<h4>7. Leaders establish equal relationships.</h4>

<p>Anyone who has ever worked on a team knows what it feels like when the manager chooses his favorites and non-favorites. It always causes stress and tension among team members which comprises productivity.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10712864_414949598660301_9088054071801414512_n.jpg?oh=fae2d01837a2ae2a3000f50907882919&amp;oe=54D5DB78&amp;__gda__=1424870129_0066f0dd1c3aa8f1ef57f9abef7cba6d">https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10712864_414949598660301_9088054071801414512_n.jpg?oh=fae2d01837a2ae2a3000f50907882919&amp;oe=54D5DB78&amp;__gda__=1424870129_0066f0dd1c3aa8f1ef57f9abef7cba6d</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>A good leader tries to treat everyone equally and to not allow personal preferences affect the team dynamic.</p>

<p>During your life, you will face two kinds of managers: leaders and bosses. It does not matter how high the position of these individuals; bossy people are more likely to fail while those who lead will succeed.</p>

<p>Maybe the things I mentioned above do not make any sense for you now, but eventually, you will experience the difference and garner a greater understanding of which manager you prefer for your own professional life.</p>
